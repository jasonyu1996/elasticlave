# Elasticlave

**Elasticlave** is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) design which enables efficient cross-enclave data sharing.
This repository contains the prototype implementation based on [Keystone](https://keystone-enclave.org/) as described in ["Elasticlave : An Efficient Memory Model for Enclaves"](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/yu-jason) at Usenix Security Symposium 2022). For simplicity, we directly refer to this prototype implementation as Elasticlave in this document.

We support two options for running Elasticlave:
  1. On a RISC-V SoC simulated with [FireSim](https://fires.im/). This can give accurate performance data and is therefore suitable for performance benchmarking. However, it is generally much slower than the second option.
  2. On a system emulated with QEMU. It cannot provide accurate performance data but runs fast and is great for testing the functionality.

The setup of Elasticlave differs depending on the option chosen.

## On FireSim
### Requirements and Dependencies
You need to set up FireSim on AWS EC2. Elasticlave and the associated scripts in this repository
have been tested on FireSim 1.9.0, which is included as a submodule in `firesim/` along with the
Elasticlave-specific configuration files.
Please refer to the [FireSim documentation](https://docs.fires.im/en/1.9.0/) for instructions.

We have dockerised the remaining software dependencies.
See the [official website of Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for instructions on installing Docker on your system.

### Building
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasonyu1996/elasticlave.git --recursive --shallow-submodules
cd elasticlave
git submodule update --init --recursive
./docker.sh MAKE_FIRESIM=1
```

### Launching
```bash
./run-firesim.sh
```
By default, this uses FireSim in `firesim/`. If you have set up FireSim in a different directory, 
specify the `FIRESIM_HOME` environment variable:
```bash
FIRESIM_HOME=<your-firesim-directory> ./run-firesim.sh
```

## On QEMU

### Requirements and Dependencies
We have dockerised most of the software dependencies, so there should be little problem running Elasticlave on any x86-64 Linux distribution with **Docker** installed.
See the [official website of Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for instructions on installing Docker on your system.

### Building
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasonyu1996/elasticlave.git
cd elasticlave
git submodule update --init --recursive
./docker.sh
```

### Launching
```bash
./docker-run.sh ./run.sh
```

When prompted for the login, enter `root`. The corresponding password is `sifive`.

## Benchmarks

### Configuration

You can configure which benchmarks to include in the built file system. To achieve this, edit the file ``KEYSTONE_FOLDER/tests/tests/mkconfig.mk`` and uncomment the names of the benchmarks you want to include.
